            <p>For some reason I can’t find a straightforward and up-to-date version of this, so I just wrote this as I go.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167&amp;release_id=5246">Download and install the latest ruby</a>.
During installation, make sure you tick the option to associate .rb files.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126&amp;release_id=2471">Download and install Rubygems</a>.
Click setup.rb and let it run. Close the window when it says it is successfully installed.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/">Download DevKit</a>. Follow <a href="https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit">steps on github</a> to install it. (Scroll down to installation instructions.)</p></li>
<li><p>Use the same command prompt or open the command prompt again(right click to open as administrator if errored) and run <code>$ gem install rails</code> it will install a bunch of gems (rails and all its dependencies) and might take a while.</p></li>
<li><p>Install bundler buy running <code>$ gem install bundler</code>. It’d again install stuff for a while, but there’s nothing to worry about.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>And you&rsquo;re all set!</strong></p>

<p>Just go from your command prompt to an ideal directory and run <code>$ rails new [appName]</code>, obviously change [appName] to a name of your choice to start your very first app on Windows!</p>

<p>This is really not as painful as I’ve heard, and the whole process might not take longer than an hour. (I have done only 2 installation on 2 laptops, the first time did take me a while, but the second time, following my own instruction, it was painless and fast)</p>

<hr />

<p>And with Heroku, it is actually quite easy with <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart">their documentation</a>. Don’t think I need to explain more, just go ahead and follow the instructions.</p>

<p>However, there are a lot of errors for you to find along the path. Here&rsquo;s some of them:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Push failed with Heroku: Heroku ignores Windows Gemfile.lock. Go ahead and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6811013/1388427">delete these lines</a> to fix it.</p></li>
<li><p>To set up postgreSQL on heroku, run (<a href="https://postgres.heroku.com/blog/past/2012/4/26/heroku_postgres_development_plan/">refer to</a>):
 <code>$ heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:dev</code></p></li>
<li><p>500 Internal Server error with Heroku: Could not find a JavaScript runtime. Added these lines to your Gemfile:</p></li>
</ol>


<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby">  <span class="n">group</span> <span class="ss">:production</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="err">‘</span><span class="n">therubyracer</span><span class="err">’</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>  As I run sqlite on development and PG on production, I put <code>gem ‘pg’</code> in the group as well. Push, and remember to restart the server.</p>

<p>  * Note that the Ruby Racer DOES NOT run on Windows.</p>

<hr />

<p>Side note: If you run into problems with not being able to run either git/heroku on cmd,
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4492979/git-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command">Here’s the fix for git</a>
For Heroku, shell says “The system cannot find the path specified,” the problem was that I installed Ruby in a unusual path, so I just went into “program files\Heroku\bin\heroku.bat” and edit the ruby path, and it was fixed.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Update: 28 Jan 2013</strong></p>

<p>Just installed Rails again on my friend’s Windows machine, so I re-wrote some of the instructions, hope it’s a lot clearer now.</p>

<p>I got a new Mac a few month back, life is now a lot easier as a developer. But I cannot say it was painless the first time I set up rails on Mac, perhaps even more painful. The thing that made the difference was that a lot of the gems do not work on Windows, but they do on Mac. So if you’re installing Rails on Windows, you would still run into a lot of problems down the line with gems, it would be a good idea to at least start planning for a Mac. :)</p>
